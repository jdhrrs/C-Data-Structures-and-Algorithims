or this Programming Assignment, you are to create your own set of classes that may be used in later programs.  There are three classes:

Person
Address
Time
Class Person should consist of a first, middle, last name, and address. Class Person should include a constructor that takes the first, middle, and last name as parameters.

Class Address should consist of street (including number), city, state, and zip code.

Class Time should represent static time; that is, time of day on a 12-hour clock. In addition to the usual functions, this class should include method comparedTo that returns LESS, EQUAL, or GREATER.

Each class must be unit tested.

Deliverables
A working well commented program that has a heading comment section with your name, date, and a brief description of the program functionality.
A class header file(.h) should be included in the project for each class.
A class implementation file(.cpp) should be included in the project for each class.
A driver program that instantiates and tests all 3 classes and class functionality.
